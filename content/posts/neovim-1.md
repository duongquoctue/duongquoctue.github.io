## Introduction

### What is Neovim ?

<a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">Neovim</a>, often referred to as `nvim`, is a modernized version of the classic text editor <a href="https://www.vim.org/about.php" target="_blank">Vim</a>, which is a time-tested and beloved tool among programmers, writers, and system administrators due to its efficiency and <a href="https://www.brwong.net/blog/keyboard-centric-operation" target="_blank">keyboard-centric philosophy</a>
