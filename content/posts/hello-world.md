Hello from Hugo!

A Section
---------

Here's a simple titled section where you can place whatever information you want.

You can use inline HTML if you want, but really there's not much that Markdown can't do.

Showing off with Markdown
-------------------------

A full cheat sheet can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
or through [Google](https://google.com/).

There are some *easy* examples for styling, though. I can't **emphasize** that enough.
Creating [links](https://google.com/) or `inline code` blocks are very straightforward.
